# Introduction

Hello everyone,

In this project, I tried to follow this [YouTube series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvz5lCwTgdXByZ_z-LFo4vJbbFIMPhkkM&si=Y9YvVVVBlJ2wQQbO) and explain every step in an easy way so everyone could get it.
As a model, I've used the CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) algorithm, which is part of the Deep Learning Algorithms. As a dataset, I've used the "fruit-and-vegetable-image recognition" dataset.

First, I want to start with our dataset. Our dataset contains 3 different files, and each file has as many subfolders (36) as the number of classes. Our subfolders contain the relevant class images.

Before moving on to the modelling phase, we preprocessed our training and validation datasets for our model. Then we adjusted the necessary parameters for our model and created our final model.

We evaluated our model, which is in its final stage.

In the last part of the project, I took care to share the model score changes over time with visualisation techniques.


Additionally, I share a resource on how model development is done in the "Plus +" section. Those who are curious can take a look.
